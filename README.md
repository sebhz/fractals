# Playing with fractals

Various programs, scripts and other trials around fractals.
Most are pretty old, but I periodically check they still compile and work
more or less as intended.

Those little programs were mostly written out of boredom, or for exploration.
If you are looking for *real* fractal generation and visualization software,
there are plenty very good ones available. Ask your favorite search
engine.

# License

All the programs in this github repository are GPL - even if I doubt those half-baked scripts would be of any use to anyone. Feel free to use any of them under the GPL terms !
