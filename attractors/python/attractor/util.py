	Computes the number of iterations necessary to have the attractor

		AttractorType: either 'polynomial' or 'dejong'. De Jong attractors typically
		               require more iterations
		geometry: a (w,h) tuple giving the final picture width and height in pixels

	Pads and enlarges a window to center it in a larger window whose aspect ratio is given.

	Arguments:

		    x0, y0 are the coordinates of the bottom left point
		    x1, y1 are the coordinates of the top right point
		sd: the screen dimension, as a (w, h) tuple
			w and h are respectively the width and height of the screen
		pct: the percentage of padding to be applied in both direction

	Returns a tuple (X0, Y0, X1, Y1) representing wc padded by pct % in
